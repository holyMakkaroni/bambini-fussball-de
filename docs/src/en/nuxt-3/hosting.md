We host our Nuxt 3 application on AWS Amplify, fully integrated with our Git repository to enable automatic deployments with every commit. It's powerful infrastructure to ensure our site is fast, secure, and scalable.

Our setup leverages Nitro servers for efficient Server-Side Rendering (SSR), enhancing performance and SEO. Combined with AWS Amplify's CDN structure, this ensures fast and reliable content delivery worldwide, offering users a smooth and responsive experience.
